Explanation of the concept of Git and Github 
 
GitHub is not a repository for distributing software. Instead, it is a website that enables people to develop projects using git. 
It can be used to organize work among multiple people, or to track changes in artwork and design files. 
It can also be used to track progress over time. 
GitHub Flow is a lightweight branch-based workflow that supports teams and projects that are regularly deployed. 
This guide explains how and why the GitHub process works. 
Create a branch When you are working on a project, there will be a lot of different features or ideas in progress at any given time, 
some of which are ready and some are not. Branches exist to help you manage this workflow. 
When you create a branch in a project, you are creating an environment where you can test new ideas. 
Changes you make to the branch will not affect the main branch, so you can experiment and commit the changes, 
knowing that your branch will not be merged until it is ready for the people you work with to review. 
Expert advice Branching is a core concept in Git, and the entire GitHub process builds on it. 
There is only one rule: any item in the master branch can always be implemented.
Therefore, when working on functions or arrays, it is very important to create new branches outside of the main branch. 
The name of your branch should be descriptive (for example, refactorauthentication, usercontentcachekey, makeretinaavatars) 
so that others can see what is being processed.
